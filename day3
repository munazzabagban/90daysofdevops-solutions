It seems like you have a list of tasks related to file operations and commands in a Unix-like environment. I'll guide you through each of these tasks step by step:

1. To view what's written in a file:
   ```
   cat filename
   ```

2. To change the access permissions of files:
   ```
   chmod permissions filename
   ```
   Replace "permissions" with the desired permission settings (e.g., 755 for read, write, execute for owner, and read and execute for others).

3. To check which commands you have run till now:
   ```
   history
   ```

4. To remove a directory/folder (make sure it's empty):
   ```
   rmdir directory_name
   ```

5. To create a `fruits.txt` file and view the content:
   ```
   touch fruits.txt
   cat fruits.txt
   ```

6. Add content to `devops.txt` (one item per line):
   ```
   echo -e "Apple\nMango\nBanana\nCherry\nKiwi\nOrange\nGuava" > devops.txt
   ```

7. Show only the top three fruits from the file:
   ```
   head -n 3 devops.txt
   ```

8. Show only the bottom three fruits from the file:
   ```
   tail -n 3 devops.txt
   ```

9. To create another file `Colors.txt` and view the content:
   ```
   touch Colors.txt
   cat Colors.txt
   ```

10. Add content to `Colors.txt` (one item per line):
    ```
    echo -e "Red\nPink\nWhite\nBlack\nBlue\nOrange\nPurple\nGrey" > Colors.txt
    ```

11. To find the difference between `fruits.txt` and `Colors.txt` files:
    ```
    diff fruits.txt Colors.txt
    ```
   This command will show the differences between the two files.

Make sure you replace `filename` and `directory_name` with the actual names of the files and directories you are working with.
